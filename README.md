## Project

Our aim in this project is to provide a machine learning model such that multiple data sources (in our case hospitals) could benefit for prediction purposes of their patients’ data. Since patient data is private and hospitals are not allowed to share them; building a common model that every hospital can make use of without exposing the raw data, is the main purpose of this project. 

What will make this model so robust is the fact that the common machine learning model that will be trained in a centralized server will benefit from updates from multiple hospitals. Since a model that will be trained on data that one hospital has will not be as widely applicable as we want our model to be, we will be collecting gradient updates from several clients/hospitals. Local updates will be calculated from each hospital which will use the model from the server for training.
